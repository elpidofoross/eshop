    <h2>Welcome to Hoodie Haven</h2>

    <!-- Company description -->
    <p>Founded in 2018 by a small collective of software engineers and fashion enthusiasts in Amsterdam, Hoodie Haven was born from late-night hackathons and endless cups of coffee. Our mission? To create the perfect hoodie for tech lovers, gamers, coders, and creatives around the world.</p>

    <p>We understand the struggle of cold server rooms and marathon coding sessions. Thatâ€™s why every Hoodie Haven product is designed with ultra-soft fabrics, hidden utility pockets, device-safe linings, and an ergonomic fit for maximum comfort during your next deep dive into code or your next Netflix binge.</p>

    <p>From humble beginnings shipping hoodies from a single garage, weâ€™ve now grown into a global community of comfort-seekers who never compromise on style or function. Whether youâ€™re debugging at 3 AM, working remotely from a cafÃ©, or simply relaxing at home, Hoodie Haven has got your back (literally).</p>

    <p>Join the movement. Wear your hustle.</p>
